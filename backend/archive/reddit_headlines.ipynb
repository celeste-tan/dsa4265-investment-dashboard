      "\n",
      "5. **Speculative Trading**: Many posts focus on options trading, with a significant number of users engaging in put options, indicating a bearish sentiment. This is further compounded by talk of Tesla being a crowded trade and discussions around potential massive losses for those heavily invested.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Mixed Performance Indicators**: Despite some positive news, like record vehicle deliveries, the overall sentiment leans bearish as many users are skeptical about Tesla's sustainability and valuation amidst external pressures and internal challenges.\n",

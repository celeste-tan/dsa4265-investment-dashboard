The Environmental Risk Score is relatively low at 3.04, reflecting the company's commitment to sustainable energy solutions, such as electric vehicles and solar products. This positions Tesla favorably in the green technology space, aligning with global sustainability goals.\n\nHowever, the Social Risk Score stands at 14.13, indicating significant challenges in areas such as labor practices, supply chain ethics, and community relations. This elevated score suggests that Tesla may face reputational and operational risks, particularly concerning workforce treatment and stakeholder engagement. The company has faced criticism over workplace conditions and labor disputes, which could impact its social license to operate.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 is moderate, suggesting some concerns around board diversity, executive compensation, and shareholder rights. While Tesla's innovative leadership is a strength, governance practices could benefit from enhancements to mitigate potential risks related to decision-making and accountability.\n\nThe Controversy Level of 3.0, above the peer average of 1.75, indicates that Tesla has faced notable controversies, which could affect investor sentiment and market performance. The range of peer controversy (0.0 to 4.0) highlights that while Tesla is not the worst in its sector, it is under scrutiny compared to its peers.\n\nOverall, while Tesla leads in environmental initiatives, it must address social and governance risks to enhance its sustainability profile and mitigate potential threats to its operations and reputation.",

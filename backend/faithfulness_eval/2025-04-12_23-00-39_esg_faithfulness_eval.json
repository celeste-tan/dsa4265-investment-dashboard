        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed ESG profile based on its risk scores and controversy levels. With a total ESG risk score of 24.76, the company's performance indicates notable risks, particularly in the social and governance dimensions.\n\nThe Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 is relatively low, reflecting Tesla's core business model focused on electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions, which positions the company favorably in the context of climate change mitigation. However, the Social Risk Score of 14.13 raises significant concerns, suggesting potential issues related to labor practices, supply chain management, or customer relations. This score is notably higher than the peer controversy average of 1.75, indicating that Tesla may face greater scrutiny and reputational risks in this area.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 suggests moderate governance challenges, potentially involving board diversity, executive compensation, or shareholder rights. The controversy level of 3.0 indicates that Tesla has faced notable public and media scrutiny, which can affect investor sentiment and corporate reputation.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla's environmental efforts are commendable, the elevated social and governance risks necessitate close monitoring. Investors should consider these factors when assessing Tesla's long-term sustainability and the potential impact on its financial performance and brand reputation. Addressing social and governance issues will be crucial for mitigating risks and enhancing overall ESG performance.",

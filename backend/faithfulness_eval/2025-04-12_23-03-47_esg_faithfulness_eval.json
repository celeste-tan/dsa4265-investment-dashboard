        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) demonstrates a mixed ESG profile, with a total ESG risk score of 24.76 indicating some level of sustainability risk. The Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 is relatively low, suggesting that the company is performing well in terms of environmental impact, particularly given its focus on electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions. However, this positive aspect is overshadowed by a notably high Social Risk Score of 14.13, which raises concerns regarding stakeholder relations, labor practices, and community engagement.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 is also a point of concern, reflecting potential issues in corporate governance practices. The controversy level of 3.0, which is significantly above the peer average of 1.75, indicates that Tesla has faced more significant scrutiny and negative media attention than its peers. This may include issues related to CEO behavior, labor practices, or regulatory compliance.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla's environmental initiatives are commendable, the elevated social and governance risks signal potential vulnerabilities. Investors should be aware of the controversies surrounding the company, as they could impact its reputation and long-term sustainability. Effective management of these risks will be crucial for Tesla to enhance its ESG standing and maintain investor confidence.",

This score suggests that while the company has some strengths, there are notable areas of concern, particularly in its social and governance dimensions.\n\nThe environmental risk score of 2.05 indicates that Apple is relatively well-positioned in terms of environmental impact, reflecting its ongoing commitment to sustainability initiatives, such as carbon neutrality in its supply chain by 2030 and efforts to use recycled materials in product manufacturing.\n\nHowever, the social and governance risk scores, both at 8.35, raise red flags. The social score highlights potential issues related to labor practices, supply chain management, and community relations. Governance concerns may stem from board diversity, executive compensation, and shareholder rights, which could affect stakeholder trust and corporate reputation.\n\nThe controversy level of 3.0, while aligned with the maximum observed among peers, suggests that Apple has faced significant scrutiny and criticism. This level is concerning, especially when compared to its peer average of 0.56, indicating that Apple is dealing with more controversies than many of its competitors.\n\nIn conclusion, while Apple demonstrates a robust approach to environmental sustainability, its elevated social and governance risks, combined with a high controversy level, warrant close monitoring. Investors should weigh these factors carefully when considering the potential impact on long-term sustainability and financial performance.",

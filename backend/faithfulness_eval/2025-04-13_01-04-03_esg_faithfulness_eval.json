        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) exhibits a total ESG risk score of 24.76, indicating that while the company is a significant player in the sustainable energy sector, it faces several risks across environmental, social, and governance dimensions. \n\nThe Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 is relatively low, reflecting Tesla's commitment to reducing carbon emissions through electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions. However, this strength is somewhat overshadowed by the higher Social Risk Score of 14.13, suggesting potential challenges related to labor practices, employee relations, or community engagement. This score indicates that social factors could pose notable risks to Tesla's reputation and operational sustainability.\n\nAdditionally, the Governance Risk Score of 7.6 indicates moderate concerns. Governance issues may relate to board composition, executive compensation, or transparency practices. The controversy level of 3.0, significantly above the peer average of 1.75, highlights that Tesla is frequently in the limelight for various controversies, which could impact investor sentiment and stakeholder trust.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla's environmental initiatives position it favorably in the transition to a sustainable economy, substantial social and governance risks, compounded by a high controversy level, could hinder its long-term sustainability and performance. Investors should closely monitor these factors to assess potential impacts on the company's reputation and operational continuity.",

The environmental risk score of 2.05 is relatively low, suggesting that Apple has made strides in minimizing its environmental impact, particularly with initiatives aimed at sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. However, the social and governance risk scores are both at 8.35, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in areas such as labor practices, supply chain management, and corporate governance frameworks.\n\nThe controversy level of 3.0 places Apple within the higher range among its peers, which may indicate heightened scrutiny or negative public perception linked to its operations.

Investors should consider these factors when assessing the company's long-term sustainability and alignment with ESG principles.

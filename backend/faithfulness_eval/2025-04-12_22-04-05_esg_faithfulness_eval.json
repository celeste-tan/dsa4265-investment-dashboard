        "Generated Report": "Tesla Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed ESG profile, characterized by a Total ESG Risk Score of 24.76, which indicates a moderate level of risk. The Environmental Risk Score is relatively low at 3.04, reflecting the company\u2019s commitment to sustainable energy and electric vehicle production, which are pivotal in reducing carbon emissions. However, Tesla's Social Risk Score of 14.13 raises significant concerns, highlighting potential issues related to labor practices, workplace safety, and community relations. This score suggests that while the company is advancing environmental goals, it may face challenges in social responsibility.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 points to some deficiencies in corporate governance practices, which may include issues related to board diversity, executive compensation, and shareholder rights. \n\nThe Controversy Level of 3.0 indicates a heightened level of scrutiny surrounding the company, especially compared to its peers, with a maximum peer controversy of 4.0 and an average of 1.75. This suggests that Tesla is more frequently involved in ESG-related controversies than its counterparts, which could pose reputational risks and impact investor confidence.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla\u2019s environmental initiatives are commendable, the elevated social and governance risks warrant attention. Effective management of these aspects is crucial for enhancing its overall sustainability profile and mitigating potential long-term risks.",

Similarly, the governance score suggests that there might be concerns regarding board diversity, executive compensation, or shareholder rights.\n\nThe controversy level of 3.0, on the higher end of the scale, indicates that AAPL has encountered notable issues, which could impact investor sentiment and long-term sustainability. Comparatively, the peer controversy metrics show that while AAPL has faced significant controversies, it is not alone in this regard, as the peer average is 0.56, with a maximum of 3.0.\n\nIn summary, while Apple demonstrates strong environmental sustainability efforts, the elevated social and governance risks, coupled with a high controversy level, warrant careful monitoring.

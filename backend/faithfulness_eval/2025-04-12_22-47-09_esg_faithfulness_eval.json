        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed ESG profile with a total risk score of 24.76, indicating a moderate level of overall risk. Analyzing the individual components reveals significant insights into the company's sustainability and potential risks.\n\nThe Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 is relatively low, reflecting Tesla's mission to promote sustainable energy through electric vehicles and renewable energy products. This positioning suggests minimal environmental impact compared to traditional automakers, which is a strong positive for environmentally conscious investors.\n\nConversely, the Social Risk Score of 14.13 is notably high, indicating potential challenges in areas such as labor practices, community engagement, and supply chain ethics. This score raises concerns about how Tesla manages its workforce and addresses social responsibilities, which could pose reputational risks.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6, while moderate, suggests there may be issues related to management practices and board diversity or structure that could affect long-term sustainability. \n\nFurthermore, the Controversy Level of 3.0, above the peer average of 1.75, indicates that Tesla has faced notable controversies, which could impact its brand perception and stakeholder trust. \n\nIn summary, while Tesla excels in environmental initiatives, the high social risk and elevated controversy levels warrant caution. Investors should closely monitor these factors, as they could lead to reputational damage and affect the company's long-term sustainability.",

The environmental risk score of 2.05 suggests that while AAPL is making strides in sustainability, there are still areas for improvement, particularly in reducing its carbon footprint and ensuring sustainable sourcing of materials.\n\nThe social risk score of 8.35 highlights significant challenges related to labor practices, supply chain management, and customer privacy. Given Apple\u2019s vast global supply chain, the potential for social controversies is a critical area of concern, particularly in regions with less stringent labor laws. This is further underscored by the company's controversy level of 3.0, which, while in line with its peers, indicates ongoing scrutiny and potential reputational risks.\n\nOn the governance front, AAPL's score of 8.35 reflects the importance of strong leadership, ethical practices, and shareholder rights. Although the company is recognized for its innovation and market position, governance issues related to transparency and accountability remain pertinent.\n\nIn summary, while Apple has made notable progress in certain ESG areas, the relatively high social and governance risk scores, along with the controversy level, point to potential vulnerabilities. Investors should monitor these risks closely, as they could impact both the company\u2019s reputation and financial performance in the long term.",

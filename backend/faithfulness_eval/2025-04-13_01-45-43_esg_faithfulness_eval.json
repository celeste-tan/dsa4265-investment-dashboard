The breakdown reveals a relatively low Environmental Risk Score of 3.04, suggesting that the company's operations have a favorable impact on environmental sustainability, largely due to its focus on electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions.\n\nHowever, the Social Risk Score of 14.13 raises concerns, indicating potential vulnerabilities related to labor practices, community relations, and product safety. This score, significantly higher than its environmental counterpart, may reflect challenges Tesla has faced regarding employee treatment, workplace culture, and public scrutiny over safety issues with its vehicles.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 denotes moderate governance concerns, which could be linked to executive decision-making and board structure. High-profile controversies surrounding CEO Elon Musk and corporate governance practices may also contribute to this score.\n\nWith a Controversy Level of 3.0, TSLA ranks above its peers, whose average controversy level is 1.75. This suggests that the company is involved in notable controversies that could impact its reputation and investor confidence.\n\nOverall, while Tesla shows promise in environmental sustainability, its social and governance risks warrant close scrutiny. Investors should consider the balance between its innovative potential and the reputational and operational risks associated with its social practices and governance structure.",

With a total ESG risk score of 18.75, the company exhibits a relatively low environmental risk score of 2.05, indicating a strong performance in mitigating environmental impacts. This suggests Apple's commitment to sustainability initiatives, such as renewable energy usage and responsible resource management.\n\nHowever, the social and governance risk scores, both at 8.35, highlight significant areas of concern. The social risks may stem from labor practices, supply chain ethics, and data privacy issues, which have been points of contention in the past. Governance risks may relate to corporate governance practices, board diversity, and executive compensation, indicating potential vulnerabilities in stakeholder trust.\n\nThe controversy level of 3.0, which matches the maximum observed among peers, underscores the presence of serious issues or negative media attention that could impact the company's reputation and operational stability. While the peer average controversy level is considerably lower (0.56), suggesting that AAPL faces challenges relative to its industry.\n\nIn summary, while Apple demonstrates strong environmental practices, the elevated social and governance risks, coupled with a high controversy level, necessitate vigilant monitoring.

        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed ESG profile based on its risk scores. The total ESG risk score of 24.76 suggests a moderate level of overall risk. The environmental risk score of 3.04 is relatively low, reflecting Tesla's core business model centered around electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy solutions, which contribute positively to environmental sustainability. However, the company faces significant social risks, evidenced by a score of 14.13, indicating potential challenges related to labor practices, workplace culture, and community relations.\n\nThe governance risk score of 7.6 highlights issues in corporate governance, which can impact stakeholder trust and long-term sustainability. Tesla's controversy level of 3.0 is notably higher than the peer average of 1.75, suggesting that the company has faced more significant public scrutiny and backlash compared to its peers. This elevated controversy level can pose reputational risks and may affect investor sentiment and customer loyalty.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla's environmental initiatives align with sustainability goals, the heightened social and governance risks, along with a higher controversy level, warrant careful consideration. Investors should closely monitor these factors as they could impact the company's long-term viability and market position. Addressing social and governance challenges will be crucial for Tesla to enhance its overall ESG profile and mitigate potential risks.",

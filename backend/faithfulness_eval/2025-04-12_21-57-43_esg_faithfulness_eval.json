The Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 is relatively low, suggesting that Tesla\u2019s operations align well with environmental sustainability goals, especially given its focus on electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions. However, the company\u2019s Social Risk Score of 14.13 is notably high, indicating potential vulnerabilities in areas such as labor practices, community relations, or product safety. This may reflect ongoing scrutiny regarding workplace conditions and labor relations, which could impact brand reputation and operational stability.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 indicates moderate concerns in corporate governance practices, which may involve issues related to board diversity, executive compensation, or shareholder rights. Tesla\u2019s Controversy Level of 3.0, significantly higher than the peer average of 1.75, suggests that the company has faced notable public disputes or criticisms, which could jeopardize stakeholder trust and investor confidence.\n\nOverall, while Tesla's environmental profile is robust, the elevated social risk and controversy levels highlight potential vulnerabilities that could affect its long-term sustainability. Investors should closely monitor these areas, as they represent crucial factors influencing Tesla's reputation and operational effectiveness within the rapidly evolving automotive and energy sectors.",

The Environmental Risk Score of 2.05 suggests that the company is performing well in terms of environmental practices, aligning with its commitment to sustainability initiatives such as carbon neutrality and renewable energy usage in its operations. However, the potential environmental risks seem manageable, reflecting positively on its long-term viability.\n\nIn contrast, the Social and Governance Risk Scores, both at 8.35, indicate significant challenges. The elevated social risk could stem from labor practices, supply chain management, or data privacy issues, while the governance score suggests potential concerns regarding management practices or shareholder rights. These scores warrant attention, as they can affect stakeholder trust and the company's reputation.\n\nThe controversy level at 3.0, while not the highest in its peer group, is concerning when compared to the peer average of 0.56. This signifies that Apple has faced notable controversies, which could impact its brand equity and investor sentiment. \n\nOverall, while AAPL's environmental practices are commendable, the social and governance aspects pose potential risks that could affect its sustainability in the long term.

        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed picture in its ESG analysis. With a total ESG risk score of 24.76, the company shows significant exposure to sustainability risks, particularly in its social and governance dimensions.\n\nThe Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 is relatively low, suggesting that Tesla, as a leader in electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions, manages its environmental impact effectively. The company's core mission aligns with sustainability, contributing positively to its environmental performance.\n\nConversely, the Social Risk Score of 14.13 indicates considerable challenges. This score highlights potential issues related to labor practices, community relations, and product safety that could impact Tesla's reputation and operational stability. The company's workforce dynamics and public controversies around workplace culture and employee treatment are areas of concern.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 suggests moderate risks in corporate governance practices. While Tesla has led innovations in its industry, questions around leadership, board independence, and shareholder rights remain relevant. The controversy level of 3.0 is notably higher than the peer average of 1.75, indicating that Tesla faces more significant reputational risks compared to its competitors.\n\nOverall, while Tesla's environmental performance is commendable, elevated social and governance risks warrant careful attention. Investors should monitor these aspects closely, as they could impact long-term sustainability and financial performance.",

The Environmental Risk Score of 2.05 suggests that the company has relatively low environmental concerns, reflecting its commitment to sustainability initiatives such as renewable energy usage and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. However, the Social and Governance Risk Scores, both at 8.35, highlight significant areas of concern.\n\nThe social risks may stem from labor practices, supply chain management, and product-related issues, which are critical for a company of AAPL's scale. Governance risks, on the other hand, could relate to board diversity, executive compensation, and shareholder rights, potentially impacting investor confidence and stakeholder relationships.\n\nA controversy level of 3.0 places Apple in the higher range of industry controversies, indicating that the company has faced significant public scrutiny or negative media attention. This level of controversy is notable compared to the peer average of 0.56, underscoring that while Apple excels in environmental sustainability, its social and governance practices warrant improvement.\n\nIn summary, while AAPL demonstrates strong environmental performance, the elevated social and governance risks, along with a high controversy level, suggest that there are potential vulnerabilities that could impact its long-term sustainability and investor perception. Addressing these risks will be crucial for enhancing its overall ESG profile.",

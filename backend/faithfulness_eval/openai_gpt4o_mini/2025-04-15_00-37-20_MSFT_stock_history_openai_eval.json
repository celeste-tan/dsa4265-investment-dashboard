This price reflects the company's market value and is an important reference point for investors assessing its performance compared to historical prices and forecasts.\n\n- **Volatility**: The annualized standard deviation of daily returns is 0.27. This indicates that the stock has a moderate level of price fluctuations. Higher volatility means the stock price can change dramatically in a short period, which can be both an opportunity and a risk for investors.\n\n- **200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The 200-day SMA is $417.43. This is the average price of MSFT over the last 200 days. It serves as a long-term trend indicator; when the current price is below the SMA, it may suggest that the stock is in a downtrend compared to its recent historical performance.\n\n- **200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: The 200-day EMA stands at $407.22. Unlike the SMA, the EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. This can help investors identify trends more quickly. MSFT\u2019s current price being below the EMA indicates a potential bearish trend.\n\n- **Relative Strength Index (RSI: 14-day)**: The RSI is at 45.91.

The environmental risk score of 3.04 suggests a relatively low environmental impact, which is expected given Tesla's focus on sustainable energy and electric vehicles. However, this positive aspect is overshadowed by higher risks in social (14.13) and governance (7.6) categories.\n\nThe social risk score indicates potential challenges related to labor practices, community relations, and customer satisfaction. Tesla has faced scrutiny over workplace conditions, employee treatment, and allegations of discrimination, which could impact its reputation and operational stability. The governance risk score reflects concerns about board structure, executive compensation, and transparency, which are critical for investor confidence and regulatory compliance.\n\nA controversy level of 3.0 signifies that Tesla has been involved in moderate controversies compared to its peers, whose average controversy level stands at 1.75. This indicates that while Tesla is more scrutinized than its competitors, it is not the worst performer in the industry.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla is a leader in environmental sustainability, significant social and governance risks could pose challenges to its long-term sustainability and market position. Investors should monitor these risks closely, as they may impact the company's reputation, regulatory standing, and overall performance.",

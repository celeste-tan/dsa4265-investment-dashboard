    "Ticker": "AMZN",
    "Generated Analysis": "- **Current Price**: Amazon's stock is currently priced at **$180.81**. This is the most recent value at which shares of AMZN are being traded in the market.\n\n- **Volatility**: The stock has a volatility of **0.39**, indicating a moderate level of price fluctuation. This means that the stock's price can vary significantly from its average over time, suggesting some risk but also potential for movement.\n\n- **200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The 200-day SMA is **$200.02**. This average is calculated by taking the average of the stock's closing prices over the last 200 days. Since the current price is below this average, it may indicate that the stock is in a downtrend compared to its historical performance.\n\n- **200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: The 200-day EMA is **$199.04**. Unlike the SMA, the EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to price changes. The current price being below this average strengthens the view that the stock may be underperforming in the short to medium term.\n\n- **Relative Strength Index (RSI: 14-day)**: The RSI is at **36.69**, which is below the neutral level of 50. This suggests that the stock may be oversold, meaning it has experienced more selling pressure than buying. An RSI below 30 often indicates that a stock could be undervalued, but at 36.69, it shows there's still room for potential weakening before reaching that level.",

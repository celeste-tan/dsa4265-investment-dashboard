        "Generated Report": "Tesla Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed picture in terms of ESG risk analysis. With a total ESG risk score of 24.76, Tesla's environmental risk score of 3.04 indicates a relatively low environmental impact, which is consistent with its mission to promote sustainable energy through electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions. However, the company's social risk score of 14.13 is notably high, suggesting significant concerns related to labor practices, employee relations, and customer satisfaction. This could indicate potential vulnerabilities in maintaining a positive public image and employee morale.\n\nThe governance risk score of 7.6 is moderate, pointing to potential issues in corporate governance, possibly related to leadership practices or board diversity. Additionally, Tesla's controversy level of 3.0 is concerning, especially when compared to its peers, where the average controversy level is only 1.75. This indicates that Tesla is subject to more significant public scrutiny and reputational risks than its competitors.\n\nOverall, while Tesla's environmental initiatives are commendable and align with global sustainability goals, the elevated social risk and governance concerns could pose challenges. Investors should closely monitor these factors, as they may impact the company's long-term sustainability and stakeholder trust.",

Additionally, the governance risk could be elaborated upon to clarify what specific issues are contributing to the score of 7.6. \n\nOverall, the report is mostly faithful to the provided data, but slight improvements in specificity and context could enhance its accuracy and depth."

This score may reflect concerns regarding workforce diversity, labor practices, or product safety, which could impact the company's reputation and operational stability.\n\nGovernance Risk Score of 5.65 is the highest among the three scores, pointing to potential issues in corporate governance, such as board diversity, executive compensation, or shareholder rights. This could lead to increased scrutiny from investors and stakeholders.\n\nThe controversy level of 2.0, while not the highest, is above the peer average of 0.56, indicating that NVDA has faced some significant public or regulatory challenges.

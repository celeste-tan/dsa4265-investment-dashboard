        "Generated Report": "Tesla Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed ESG profile, with a total ESG risk score of 24.76 indicating a moderate level of risk. The Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 suggests that Tesla's environmental impact is relatively low, which is expected given its core mission of promoting sustainable energy and electric vehicles. This aligns with the growing emphasis on reducing carbon footprints and transitioning to renewable energy sources.\n\nHowever, the Social Risk Score of 14.13 is significantly higher, indicating potential vulnerabilities in areas such as labor practices, community engagement, and customer satisfaction. This score suggests that Tesla may face challenges related to employee relations, particularly in its manufacturing facilities, which could affect its reputation and operational stability.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 indicates moderate concerns regarding corporate governance structures, potentially influenced by issues such as executive decisions and board diversity. This could pose risks related to transparency and accountability.\n\nThe controversy level of 3.0, compared to peer averages, highlights that Tesla is experiencing a higher degree of scrutiny than many of its competitors, which may stem from its CEO's public statements, labor issues, and regulatory challenges. Such controversies can impact investor sentiment and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla excels environmentally, it must address significant social and governance risks to enhance its sustainability profile and mitigate potential impacts on its business operations and reputation.",

The governance score highlights risks associated with corporate governance practices, including board diversity and executive compensation.\n\nThe controversy level of 3.0 is concerning, especially when compared to peer averages, which hover around 0.56. This suggests that Apple has faced significant controversies, potentially impacting its reputation and stakeholder trust. \n\nOverall, while Apple demonstrates strong environmental management, the elevated social and governance risks, compounded by a high controversy level, signal the need for ongoing vigilance and improvement in these areas.

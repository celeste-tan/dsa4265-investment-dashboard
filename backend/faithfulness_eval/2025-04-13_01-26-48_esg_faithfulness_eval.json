The Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 suggests that while Tesla is a leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, it still faces challenges related to its supply chain, resource extraction, and energy consumption.\n\nThe Social Risk Score of 14.13 is notably high, reflecting potential concerns regarding labor practices, employee relations, and community impact. This score highlights the need for Tesla to address issues such as workplace safety and diversity, which can lead to reputational damage and operational disruptions.\n\nTesla\u2019s Governance Risk Score of 7.6 indicates moderate concerns related to board structure, executive compensation, and shareholder rights.

        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed ESG risk profile with a Total ESG Risk Score of 24.76, indicating moderate risk. The Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 suggests that Tesla's commitment to sustainability through electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions is relatively strong, aligning with its mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. However, this score also indicates that there are areas for improvement, particularly concerning resource use and lifecycle impacts.\n\nThe Social Risk Score of 14.13 raises concerns, as it is considerably higher than both the Environmental and Governance scores. This suggests potential vulnerabilities related to labor practices, community relations, and product safety. Such risks could affect Tesla's reputation and operational stability, especially in light of increasing scrutiny over workplace conditions and workforce management.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 indicates moderate governance challenges, which may include issues related to executive compensation, board diversity, or shareholder rights.\n\nThe Controversy Level of 3.0 signifies that Tesla has faced notable controversies, significantly above the peer average of 1.75. This may reflect past issues such as high-profile executive behavior, regulatory scrutiny, or environmental concerns, which could pose reputational risks.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla's commitment to environmental sustainability is evident, the higher social risk and governance concerns, coupled with its controversy level, highlight potential vulnerabilities that investors should consider in their assessments of long-term sustainability and risk exposure.",

With a total ESG risk score of 18.75, the company maintains a relatively low environmental risk score of 2.05, indicating effective management of environmental impacts. This suggests that AAPL is likely implementing sustainable practices in its operations and supply chain, aligning with growing investor preferences for environmentally responsible companies.\n\nHowever, the social and governance risk scores are notably higher at 8.35 each, indicating potential vulnerabilities in these areas.

        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed profile in terms of ESG risk assessment. With a total ESG risk score of 24.76, the company's sustainability performance reflects notable challenges, particularly in its social and governance dimensions.\n\nThe Environmental Risk Score of 3.04 suggests a relatively low impact in this area, which is expected for a company focused on electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions. However, the Social Risk Score of 14.13 raises significant concerns, indicating potential vulnerabilities in labor practices, community relations, and product safety. This score is particularly noteworthy given the increasing scrutiny on the automotive industry's labor dynamics and operational ethics.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 7.6 indicates moderate governance challenges, which may encompass issues such as board diversity, executive compensation, and shareholder rights. The controversy level of 3.0, significantly above the peer average of 1.75, further underscores the perception of heightened risks associated with the company's governance and social practices.\n\nOverall, while Tesla's commitment to environmental sustainability is commendable, its elevated social and governance risks could pose challenges to its long-term viability and stakeholder trust. Investors should closely monitor developments in these areas, especially as public and regulatory scrutiny continues to increase. The company\u2019s ability to address these risks will be crucial for maintaining its leadership in the EV market and enhancing its overall ESG performance.",

The Environmental Risk Score of 2.73 suggests that the company has relatively low environmental risks, which is a positive indicator for sustainability, particularly given the growing concerns about climate change and resource usage in the tech sector.\n\nHowever, the Social Risk Score of 4.08 reveals greater potential vulnerabilities, particularly in areas related to workforce diversity, labor practices, and community relations. This score indicates that while there are some social risks, they are not insurmountable and may be manageable through proactive strategies.\n\nThe Governance Risk Score of 5.65 is the highest among the three categories, highlighting areas where NVDA may need to improve its governance structures, policies, and practices to enhance accountability and transparency. This is particularly important in an industry where regulatory scrutiny is increasing.\n\nThe Controversy Level of 2.0 indicates that NVDA has faced some controversies, but this is relatively moderate compared to its peers, where the average controversy level is significantly lower at 0.56. This suggests that while the company is not without issues, it is performing better than many of its counterparts.\n\nIn summary, while NVDA demonstrates strengths in environmental performance, its social and governance aspects warrant attention to mitigate potential risks and enhance its overall sustainability profile.",

While this is on par with the maximum level in its peer group, the average controversy score of 0.56 among peers suggests that Apple is under more scrutiny than many of its competitors, highlighting the need for improved transparency and stakeholder engagement.\n\nIn summary, while Apple has made strides in environmental sustainability, it faces substantial social and governance risks that could impact its reputation and long-term viability.

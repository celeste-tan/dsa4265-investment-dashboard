        "Generated Report": "Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) presents a mixed ESG profile with a total ESG risk score of 24.76, indicating moderate overall risk. The company excels environmentally with a low Environmental Risk Score of 3.04, reflecting its commitment to sustainable energy solutions and electric vehicle production, which contribute positively to emissions reduction.\n\nHowever, the Social Risk Score of 14.13 raises significant concerns. This elevated score suggests potential issues related to labor practices, community relations, or product safety, which could impact Tesla's reputation and operational stability. The governance aspect, with a score of 7.6, indicates room for improvement in transparency, board diversity, and shareholder rights, which are increasingly critical for investors focused on long-term sustainability.\n\nThe controversy level of 3.0, notably higher than the peer average of 1.75, indicates that Tesla has faced substantial public scrutiny or incidents that could detract from its market position. This level of controversy could lead to heightened regulatory attention and investor caution.\n\nIn summary, while Tesla's environmental initiatives are commendable, the social and governance scores highlight vulnerabilities that necessitate strategic attention. Investors should weigh these risks against the company's innovative edge and market leadership in the electric vehicle sector, recognizing that sustainability is a multifaceted challenge requiring ongoing commitment and transparency.",

The environmental risk score of 2.73 is relatively low, suggesting that the company has implemented effective practices to mitigate its environmental impact, especially considering the energy-intensive nature of the semiconductor industry. \n\nHowever, the social risk score of 4.08 is more concerning, indicating potential challenges related to labor practices, community relations, or product safety.
